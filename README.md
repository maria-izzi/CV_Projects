# CV Projects
Collection of projects developed in Computer Vision Class (2019-2020). Developed using C++.

Project 1: Draw a triangle at any randomly chosen location, using Bresenham's algorithm. Inscribe and circumscribe a circle, and draw the 9-point circle.
Project 2: Using brute force, find a vertical line that divides a set of randomly generated points in half.
Project 3: Using recursion, find a vertical line that divides a set of randomly generated points in half.
Project 4: Using a more optimized recursion, find a vertical line that divides a set of randomly generated points in half.
Project 7: Using the Quickhull algorithm, find the convex hull of a set of randomly generated points.
Project 8: Using the Graham scan algorithm, find the convex hull of a set of randomly generated points.
Project 9: Implement a basic Canny Edge detection algorithm.
Project 10: Refine the Canny Edge detection algorithm, implementing hysteresis, to reduce noise, and non-maximum suppression, to remove repetitive lines.

Little to no shell code provided by teacher.
